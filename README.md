# 🚀 LangChain Chatbot with Prompt Moderation & Database Storage  

This is my first AI-powered chatbot project using **LangChain** and **Google Gemini AI**. The chatbot is designed to handle **domain-specific queries** while restricting unrelated topics using **prompt moderation**. It also stores user messages in a **MySQL database** to maintain a conversation history.
